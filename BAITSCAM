Dear Sir,

Let me start by introducing myself, I am Mrs. Mary Clough. I live and work in Glasgow, United Kingdom. I have years of experience in investment, private equity and project financing.

A top banker friend of mine uncovered a dormant account that has GBP £19,800,000.00 (Nineteen Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Great Britain Pounds). The account had been abandoned for over ten years and could not be traced to anybody.

My friend had asked me to get a partner who will collaborate with us in retrieving the money hence I contacted you. I want you to assist us in repatriating the money. It is a deal between us. You will be greatly compensated. Part of our share will be invested in your country.

You will be presented to the bank as the Next of Kin to  the original depositor of the funds. Necessary documents and information will be made available to you at every stage.

I need your understanding and collaboration to get this money out from the bank otherwise the bank will confiscate it in coming weeks.

There is no risk involved. With my friend at the bank, everything will be legally done.

To proceed, kindly provide your following details;

Names:
Address:
Telephone number:
Age:
Occupation:

I am waiting for your immediate reply.

Warm regards
Mrs. Mary Clough
Glasgow, United Kingdom
