INSPECTION UNIT
The Delivery OF Your Consignment Boxes
J.F Kennedy International Airport New York

Hi,

I am David C. Lee, Chief Inspection Agent- United Nations Inspection
Unit at John F. Kennedy International airport, New York- working hand
in hand with Department of Homeland Security and U.S Customs and
Border Protection. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned
shipment from a Diplomat from London, UK and when scanned it revealed
an undisclosed sum of money in a metal trunk box weighing
approximately 25kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the
Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it
was declared as personal effect to avoid diversion by the shipping
agent and also the Diplomat inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees.

On my assumption, each of the boxes will contain about $3Million to
$4Million each and the consignment is still left in the storage house
till today. The consignment are two metal boxes with weight of about
25kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective
capacity: 110 LBS.). Approximately, the details of the consignment
including your name and address, the official document from United
Nation office in London are tagged on the Metal Trunk boxes.

PROVIDE YOUR NAME, PHONE NUMBER AND FULL HOME ADDRESS, TO CROSS CHECK
IF IT CORRESPONDS WITH THE NAME AND ADDRESS ON THE CONSIGNMENT
INCLUDING THE NAME OF NEAREST AIRPORT AROUND YOUR CITY AND OTHER
DETAILS.

You can send the required details to me by email for onward delivery.
All communication must be held extremely confidential. I can get
everything concluded within 5-6 hours upon your acceptance and proceed
to your address for delivery if you assure me of sharing the content
30% for me / 70% with you on my arrival to your house.

I want us to transact this business with you and share the money,
since the shipper has abandoned it and disappeared. I will pay for the
Non inspection fee and arrange for the boxes to be moved out of this
airport to your address by myself. But I will share it 30%/70% with
you. Make sure Respond to me via my (direct EMAIL: uofa7500@gmail.com )
Below is my direct telephone number. Call me as soon as you receive
this mail and send me all the requested information to my email.
